# Paleo Delights

This is a sample app primarily demonstrating the use of Firebase's features. This app is meant to be used together with Paleo Delights Rider which I shall be developing later. 

Menu items are mostly taken from PaleoHacks website.

## Stacks / templates used:

1. [Material Dialogues](https://github.com/afollestad/material-dialogs) for creating a dialogue box in the app with minimal code.

2. [Notify](https://github.com/Karn/notify) for creating a push notification within the app with minimal code.

3. Firebase Firestore for storing of menu item data as well as submitted orders.

4. Firebase Authentication for setting up phone authentication.

5. Firebase Cloud Storage for storing images of menu items.

6. Navigation Drawer template as provided by Android Studio. 

## TBD

1. Implement a more proper method for sharing data between fragments. 

2. Implement a routing, unit test and dependency injection framework.

3. Re-write the whole code into a structure that uses data binding. 

4. Create icon for the app.  

5. Improve the app's UI design to production-level.
